# Postman Audit

Protect your API by running regular audits for sensitive data, such as access tokens and passwords.
Use this CLI for searching your [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) account for this data.

## Installation:

Postman-audit is compatible with python 2.7 and 3.+, and can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

	$ pip install postman-audit

Don't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the command
line:

	$ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python

## Quickstart

Generate an API key via the [Postman integrations dashboad](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations).
Everything that you have access in Postman Pro is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.

To generate a report:

	$ postman-audit --key=POSTMAN_API_KEY --audit-value=value1 --audit-value=value2 --request-part=headers
	

## Configuration

```text
--key -k                     Postman API key. If not given, looks for environment variable POSTMAN_API_KEY
--request-part -p            Which part of the Postman request object to audit. [headers|prerequest]  
--audit-value -a             Value to search for during audit. Can provide multiple values.
--delay -d                   Delay between making request to Postman API. Defaults to 5 seconds. 
--file -f                    Configuration file for audit.
--verbose                    Verbose logging
--help                                  
```

Instead of providing audit values via the command line, use `--file` to provide a list of values in JSON format:

```json
{
	"audit_values": [
			"value1", 
			"value2"
		]
}
```

These values will be added to the list of values along with any values provided via `--audit-value`
